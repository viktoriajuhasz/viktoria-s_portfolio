# AdventureWorks SQL Query Collection

Welcome to my collection of SQL queries built using the AdventureWorks sample database â€” a popular dataset for practicing SQL and business data analysis.

This project contains SQL queries developed as part of my Data Analyst training.

# About This Repository

This repository contains a set of SQL scripts that demonstrate key SQL skills including:
- Writing complex queries involving multiple joins
- Using aggregation functions like SUM, `AVG`, `COUNT` to generate insights
- Applying filters and grouping to answer real business questions
- Utilizing Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for modular and readable queries
- Handling NULL values and applying conditional logic
- Sorting, limiting results, and formatting outputs

# Sample Use Cases

The queries address common business scenarios such as:
- Ranking salespeople by total sales, including commissions and currency conversion
- Calculating average product ratings and number of reviews
- Listing top products by total order quantities
- Analyzing sales volumes and prices by product category and subcategory
- Summarizing sales data for specific time periods (e.g. year 2014)

# Notes

- These queries are based on the AdventureWorks database.
- Depending on the environment, some syntax adjustments may be necessary. 
- All queries include descriptive comments explaining their purpose and logic.

# How to Use

1. Load the AdventureWorks sample database in your SQL Server environment.  
2. Open the files containing SQL queries included in this repository.  
3. Execute queries as needed to explore data or test functionality.  
4. Modify queries to fit your specific use cases or datasets.
